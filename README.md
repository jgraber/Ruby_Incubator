Ruby Incubator
==============

The Incubator is a place to put all the different Ruby scripts that are too small to be a gem on their own.

* [GPS Info](./GPS_info) - a script to extract GPS information from images (via EXIF tags).
* [InCVS](./InCVS/) - a script to extract CVS entries from a file when an id column is in the list of allowed IDs.
* [IndexMaker](./IndexMaker/) - a script to make an index.html with all files in folder.
* [Fileaway](./fileaway) - a script to rename files with the folder name they are in. 
* [Foldersplit](./foldersplit) - a script to move files in a folder with their create date.
